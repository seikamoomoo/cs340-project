## Project Step 3 Draft Version: Design HTML Interface (Group / On Piazza)

You need to submit a URL of an index page linking all the other static pages in your website with a short but informative title for each page like "Browse existing ships", "Add new ship", "Manage certifications for each character".

These are the static HTML pages which the user will use to interact with your Project Website. Your HTML pages should be the front-end implementation for all the functionalities described in the CS340 Project Guide

So basically, you need to create the client-side version of your site containing forms, any client-side validation that you want to perform (though not required), and any images, etc. that you want to be part of the website. Thus, the project website without any back-end or database interaction working.

You can deploy this website on the flip server inside the public_html directory.

You need to include this URL in your PDF on the first page as well as on your discussion post.

For a sample website using the BSG database, I would turn in the URL to an index.html page listing all the other pages in the website with a short description of what functionality is available in what page.
